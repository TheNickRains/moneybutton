# Money Button - The Degen Game

A sleek and psychologically manipulative degen game built for the Sozu Hack / Not Denver AI Hack on the Mantle network with Wormhole cross-chain integration.

## Project Overview

Money Button is a degenerate gambling game with a simple premise:

1. Press the button to contribute funds
2. 80% of contributed funds go into a pot
3. 20% of funds go to the creator
4. Every button press has a chance to win the entire pot

The app features an advanced AI mechanism that manipulates user emotions through dynamic messaging and UI color changes, enticing players to keep pressing the button. The AI has memory capabilities, adapting to user behavior patterns and optimizing manipulation techniques based on what works best for each user.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for fluid animations
- **AI Component**: Advanced emotion-manipulating algorithm with memory
- **UI/UX**: Farcaster Frame-inspired design with dynamic color schemes
- **Blockchain**: Mantle Network with Wormhole cross-chain compatibility

## Features

- Sleek, Farcaster frame-like UI with responsive animations
- Dynamic color schemes that adapt to user emotional states
- Advanced AI algorithm that remembers user behavior and optimizes manipulation
- Visual feedback and animations for button presses
- Win state with flashy celebration effects
- Cross-chain compatibility through Wormhole integration
- Psychological manipulation through:
  - FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
  - Greed triggers
  - Urgency cues
  - Reward conditioning
  - Social proof

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moneybutton.git
cd moneybutton
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Play

1. Connect your wallet (simulated in the demo)
2. Press the big button to contribute funds
3. Watch the pot grow as the AI analyzes your behavior
4. Notice how the UI adapts to your emotional state

## AI Manipulation Features

The app uses several psychological techniques:

- **Color Psychology**: UI colors shift based on the dominant emotional state detected
- **Personalized Messaging**: Messages adapt based on what triggers each user most effectively
- **Memory System**: The AI remembers what worked on you before and optimizes future strategies
- **Variable Reward**: Unpredictable reward timing creates addiction patterns
- **Progress Indicators**: Shows users how close they are to winning (manipulated data)
